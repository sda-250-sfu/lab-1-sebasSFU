 When doing data science there are two major ethical consideration that one must
 consider. First, establishing how to collect this data in an ethical manner. More
 speciffically, how to establish that for every piece of data there is a human
 subject\n attatched to it. If one is working with publicly available data, or
 data for which the human subject has given informed consent, consent that is
 more meaninful than, say, a checkbox at the end of a long legal addendum,
 then one must consider that the techniques used will not produce information
 which is outside the scope of what was agreed upon by the human subjects. This
 is to say, that one must consider how powerful the tools that one is developing
 are, and that they do not reveal private information.
